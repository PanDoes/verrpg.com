                        <h1 id="the-basics"><a class="header" href="#the-basics">The Basics</a></h1>
<p>This section is all about teaching you the basics of Tales of Ver on a
conceptual level, rather than a mechanical one. You won’t learn how to attack a
goblin, or become a raging mechanical barbarian, but you will learn what the
game is about, what you’ll need to play, and a lot of the words we use to talk
about Tales of Ver in later chapters.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-tales-of-ver"><a class="header" href="#what-is-tales-of-ver">What is Tales of Ver?</a></h1>
<p>Tales of Ver is a roleplaying game like Pathfinder, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Mutants
&amp; Masterminds, and more. The game gives you a world and character that you can
explore with your friends. Tales of Ver or ToV for short is all about
storytelling freedom in the world of Ver.</p>
<h1 id="sculpting-a-body--personality"><a class="header" href="#sculpting-a-body--personality">Sculpting a Body &amp; Personality</a></h1>
<p>What is a character? On a character sheet a character is a collection of stats,
skills, talents, and items, representing what the character is good and bad at.
In a story a character is a collection of values, goals, beliefs, and
potentially a sense of justice. It represents a person. This is what you should
set out to build when creating a character in Ver.</p>
<p>When crafting your character the game will guide you through finding out what
you are good at (and what you are bad at), but it is up to you to really shape
your character. Ask yourself questions like why you are good at weilding a
sword, or why you can chop a tree down really well. These will guide you nicely
into a character that feels whole and complete. Be hesitant to fill in every
detail though, one of the joys of roleplaying is discovering parts about your
character you never knew as the story develops.</p>
<p>The game will give you strengths and weaknesses, a fun character will have just
as interesting strengths as weaknesses. Lean into your strengths, if you are
good with a sword, then enter competitions, or train others, let it help define
you. Similarly, if you cannot barter whatsoever, then perhaps shopping is a big
hobby of yours, or you’ve always wanted to open a shop for yourself. Leaning
into your strengths will make you feel incredible, and leaning into your
weaknesses will have you laughing hard.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Be sure to think of your character as a real person, rather than a collection
of statistics. Ask yourself questions about why you’re good at different things.
Lean into your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-character-sheet">What is a Character Sheet</a></h1>
<p>A character sheet is a tool for you to remember all the information about your
character. This can be whatever works best for you; a piece of paper, a
spreadsheet, an encrypted document.  We have provided a character sheet pdf file
with most everything you need. Be sure to keep good track of this, especially if
you’re recording it on paper.</p>
<p>Individual stats and attributes can be found all throughout the rules, but the
ones you need to record on your character sheet have also been collected into
the Character Sheet Cheat Sheet for convenience. If you keep forgetting a stat,
don’t be afraid to write down the equation for it on your character sheet,
rather than constantly referencing the Cheat Sheet.</p>
<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>A Character sheet is where you keep track of the various statistics for your
character. You can use the provided PDF file, or create your own. If you ever
don’t know what is supposed to go some place on your character sheet, check the
Character Sheet Cheat Sheet.</p>
<h1 id="character-sheet-details"><a class="header" href="#character-sheet-details">Character Sheet Details</a></h1>
<p>Below are the details of the different slots, and textboxes on your character sheet, broken into a few different sections. This refers to the original pdf, but if you are using your own the formulas, and general uses for different sections will be similar.</p>
<h2 id="identifiers-section"><a class="header" href="#identifiers-section">Identifiers Section</a></h2>
<p>In the top left of the pdf are 4 stats, Character Name, Level, LP, and Victory/Despair.</p>
<p>Character name is the name of your character. This is just an identifier. Maybe your real name is “Stanley”, but you go by “Dark Shadow.” Whatever it is, it is the best name to call your character.</p>
<p>Level is a number from 1 to 10 which tells how experienced you are. It starts at 1, unless otherwise specified, and goes up by 1 every time you have checked victory and despair.</p>
<p>LP ranges from about 0 to 50. LP is used to buy Skills and Talents. You’ll gain about 5 LP for every level. It’ll start at 0.</p>
<p>Victory/Despair These are checkboxes. You gain a Victory (the top half) whenever something really good happens to you. You gain a Despair (the bottom half) whenever something really bad happens to you. Once both have been checked then you gain a level, and remove the check marks.</p>
<h2 id="information-section"><a class="header" href="#information-section">Information Section</a></h2>
<p>In the top right of the pdf are 10 different bits of information, including mechanical information, like Player Name, Race, and Body type, as well as more informative stats like, Worship, Age, Weight and Height.</p>
<p>Player Name is your real life name, or whatever you’d like to be called.</p>
<p>Race is your character’s race, you select it at character creation and it influences body type, as attributes, and racials.</p>
<p>Body Type is determined by your race, and influences your Toughness, Carrying, and other things.</p>
<p>Worship is whatever your character’s faith is, or highest thing you answer to. This can be left blank if you are unsure, or could be a God, Association, Friend, or even yourself. In general this would be a God or being of high power that you follow though.</p>
<p>Homeland is wherever your character is from.</p>
<h1 id="character-progression"><a class="header" href="#character-progression">Character Progression</a></h1>
<p>Characters start at Level 1 with 0 Learning Points, Victory, and Despair. Level
and Learning Points (LP) are the two different ways that your character grows.
Level growth represents your character’s core features, and their growth as a
person. While LP represents how skillful your character is.</p>
<h2 id="levels"><a class="header" href="#levels">Levels</a></h2>
<p>You gain Levels by combining one point of Victory and Despair. Victory is gained
by experiencing significant emotional and material victories or good fortune;
Despair is gained by experiencing significant defeat, emotional Despair, and
failing when you most needed to succeed. You cannot have more than one “point”
of Victory or Despair at a time, and when you level up you consume one “point”
of Victory and Despair. Events which gain you Victory and Despair should be of a
magnitude sufficient to make a lasting impression on them; The Level 5 hero of
the realm won’t remember every bandit they’ve ever killed, but might remember
rallying the militia of their hometown to defend against a goblin hoard. To grow
to Level 2 for instance your Level 1 character might gain a point of Victory by
protecting a beggar from a pair of street thugs, and then a point of Despair by
having their equipment stolen by those same street thugs the next night. When
your character dies or retires you should be able to write out all of their
Victory and Despair, and what caused them, and gain a good feel for the
character’s journey as a person. Levels range from 1 to 10. A level 1 character
is roughly equivalent to a working class normal peasant, largely unremarkable. A
Level 5 character is likely a well established member of the world. Possibly
known locally for their skills and abilities. A Level 10 character is at the
pinnacle of what is possible for mortal beings and can stand up to gods, and
maybe even dragons. As you gain Levels your Attributes and other Stats will
improve.</p>
<h2 id="learning-points-lp"><a class="header" href="#learning-points-lp">Learning Points (LP)</a></h2>
<p>Your GM will distribute LP to the party as you complete, either failing or
succeeding, at different challenges. This could be fighting a monster, or
failing to steal something from a noble, but, like Victory and Despair are
gained only from problems that challenge your characters and force them to grow
and adapt. Though GMs can distribute LP however they like, you should be gaining
around five LP per Level. That is, around the time you have 5 LP, you should
also be leveling up to second Level, 10 LP should coincide roughly with Level 2,
and so on. LP is used to buy and upgrade Skills, and improve your character with
special Talents. Talents represent significant changes or improvements to your
character and can drastically change how they play and interact with the world.
Your Talent Cap, the number of Talents you can buy, is equal to \(1+\frac{Level}{4}.\)</p>
<h2 id="starting-at-higher-levels"><a class="header" href="#starting-at-higher-levels">Starting at Higher Levels</a></h2>
<p>If you and your group decide not to start at Level 1, use the table below to
figure out starting amounts of LP for each Level. It is also recommended that
GMs try to keep their players in the same ballpark in terms of levels as they
advance, so you don’t have a party of level 3s with one level 5.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
<p>Also keep in mind the amount of history, and notoriety your character has should
make sense for your Level. A Level 1 represents potential, your first few
adventures, Victory, and Despair will make up their backstory. A Level 3 or
higher character though is likely somewhat established. Think about what they
did to get where they are now, who they hurt and helped in doing so, and how
they are known in the world around them.</p>
<h2 id="summary-2"><a class="header" href="#summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<p>You start at Level 1 with 0 LP. Levels and Learning Points (LP) represent how
experienced your character is, from a Level 1 peasant, to a Level 10 god-slayer.
You gain Levels from experiencing good things (Victories), and bad things (a
Despair). Similarly you gain LP from attempting challenges. Both LP and
Victories/Despairs should be gained from events relative to your character’s
power. A Level 10 would not gain a Victory for defeating some thieves.</p>
<h1 id="attributes"><a class="header" href="#attributes">Attributes</a></h1>
<p>Attributes are your character’s core stats, and are the simplest distillation of
your character’s capabilities. There are 6 Attributes each with scores which
range from -15 to 15. When your character does something that requires a die
roll you will always add one of these Attributes to the result, probably along
with other bonuses from Skills and Equipment.</p>
<h2 id="vigor-vig"><a class="header" href="#vigor-vig">Vigor (VIG)</a></h2>
<p>Vigor is your raw strength, and physical limits of your body. It allows you to
wear heavier armor into battle, and become a walking tank. You can also wield
heavy weapons like Great Axes, Long bows, and Halberds. Crush stone with your
bare hands and break down doors with your bare feet. Higher Vigor will let you
chop down trees in a single blow, pick up 10m high stone statues, and win every
game of tug o’ war. Lower Vigor leaves you meek and fragile, easy to wound, and
struggling to carry the groceries home from the market.</p>
<h2 id="dexterity-dex"><a class="header" href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity (DEX)</a></h2>
<p>Dexterity is how well you can control your own body. It increases your reflexes
and ability to dodge physical attacks. It allows you to move quickly and
precisely, balancing on thin rafters, moving silently, performing elaborate
dances and disabling deadly traps. You can use lighter weapons like Daggers,
Short bows, and Spears. High Dexterity will let you slip past the palace guards
unnoticed and remove ancient golden idols from their pressure plates without
triggering the boulder trap. Low Dexterity will cause you to slip and stumble
over even the smallest obstacles and accidentally drop the measuring cup of
water as you move it from the water basin to the mixing bowl.</p>
<h2 id="education-edu"><a class="header" href="#education-edu">Education (EDU)</a></h2>
<p>Education is your learned knowledge and learning ability. It allows you to learn
more Skills and Languages, and remember important bits of trivia as well as
where you parked your horse drawn carriage. It also encompasses known academic
knowledge, and can be used to identify magic, alchemy, and technological items.
Some types of magic also rely on Education. High Education will turn you into a
walking library of facts, drawing upon the esoteric techniques of the worlds
greatest minds. Low Education will have you scratching your head in confusion,
getting lost, and struggling to remember which berries you should and shouldn’t
be eating.</p>
<h2 id="cognition-cog"><a class="header" href="#cognition-cog">Cognition (COG)</a></h2>
<p>Cognition is your raw mental processing power, and the ability to adapt to
unfamiliar circumstances and think on your feet. It lets you win debates with
sound logic, and outwit your opponents using new and innovative strategies.
Cognition is also important for application of some academics, such as high
level mathematics, mechanics, magic, and alchemy. Cognition is also used to
compile clues into conclusions, and predict what people will do next. It is also
used for some types of magic. High Cognition will turn you into a mastermind of
prediction and reasoning, solving crimes and picking apart your enemies schemes
as if they were toddlers. Low Cognition leaves you vulnerable to even the
simples tricks and logical fallacies and will make any kind of mental exertion
simply exhausting.</p>
<h2 id="resolve-res"><a class="header" href="#resolve-res">Resolve (RES)</a></h2>
<p>Resolve is your strength of will and ability to manipulate your own spirit and
emotions. It allows you to regenerate faster, get back up after getting knocked
down, and protects you from mental and spiritual intrusions. It also represents
your emotional stability and self confidence, which is essential in getting
others to put their confidence in you. Resolve can also weaponize your own
emotion through personal mementos, allowing you to harm enemies, or protect
allies, and manipulate your own spirit to attack or hide your presence. Many
gods look for followers with high resolve and grant them their powers. High
Resolve will let you gain the trust of the masses, and stand firm in the face of
certain defeat. Low Resolve will have you cringing away from even minor wounds,
and leave you vulnerable to coercion.</p>
<h2 id="connection-cnt"><a class="header" href="#connection-cnt">Connection (CNT)</a></h2>
<p>Connection and ability to manipulate and perceive the spirits of other
creatures. It allows you to manipulate social situations, and get a better read
on people around you. It also represents how attuned you are with the Bond, a
spiritual network which connects every living thing. This can allow you to sense
nearby spirits, use special Idols to mentally attack and manipulate targets, and
use musical instruments to create wide reaching spiritual buffs and effects.
Connection also allows you to maintain and use more spiritually imbued items at
once. High Connection will charm others, out barter the owner of the local
pawnshop, or detect the spirits of living things through walls and hiding
places. Low Connection will render you socially awkward, and make it difficult
for you to notice and understand other living things.</p>
<h2 id="starting-attribute-values"><a class="header" href="#starting-attribute-values">Starting Attribute Values</a></h2>
<p>When making a character your starting attributes are determined by rolling a d6,
and subtracting 5 from the result. You will do this six times and can choose
which attribute each value goes to. So when creating your character, roll 1d6
and subtract 5, six times. This will give you values between -4, and 1. You can
then add a total of 3 points to your attributes, split in any way you’d like: +1
to three attributes, +2 to one, and +1 to another, or +3 to one. You will repeat
this process of adding 3 points to your Attributes every time you level up. But
make sure not to go over your attribute cap.</p>
<h2 id="attribute-caps"><a class="header" href="#attribute-caps">Attribute Caps</a></h2>
<p>There are caps to how high an attribute can be at any given level determined by
the table below.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Level</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td align="right">6</td><td align="right">7</td><td align="right">8</td><td align="right">9</td><td align="right">10</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<p>Racial, equipment, and other bonuses to Attributes are applied after the Stat
Cap, and allow you to exceed it. For instance, a race which gives you +1 to
Vigor, could have a Vigor of 5 at level 1, and then gain the +1 from their race,
causing them to have a Vigor of 6. It is a good idea to record this as 5+1 on
your character sheet so you can distinguish from your bonus and your attribute.</p>
<h2 id="summary-3"><a class="header" href="#summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<p>The Attributes, and what they are used for are, in short: Vigor: Your strength
and athletic abilities. Heavy weapons.  Dexterity: Your precision and agility.
Light weapons.  Education: Your memory and academic knowledge. Some magical
effects.  Cognition: Your mental prowess and intuition. Some magical effects.
Resolve: Your spiritual strength and self confidence. Emotional effects.
Connection: Your social aptitude, and spiritual perception. Mental and musical
effects.</p>
<p>Attributes are the core of your character, split into 6 different statistics,
each allowing you to do different things. You calculate them by rolling 1d6-5
six times. Once you’ve rolled them all, you choose where each result goes. At
each level (including level 1) you will add 3 attributes points, which can be
split between the 6 different attributes however you’d like. There is a limit to
how high an attribute can go based on your level. Racial mods, equipment, and
other bonuses are applied after this cap, allowing you to surpass it.</p>
<h1 id="your-characters-race"><a class="header" href="#your-characters-race">Your Character’s Race</a></h1>
<p>Your race is a very fundamental part of your character. Your race influences your Attributes, and also gives you a passive. More importantly every race has stereotypes and culture associated with it that informs what type of character you’ll play, and how other characters in the game will react to you. Races all derive from a Kin. You have Dwarf-kin, and then the different races of Dwarves. Elf-kin, and then the different races of Elves. Kin all share some ancestors, or are born in similar ways.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-race"><a class="header" href="#choosing-a-race">Choosing a Race</a></h2>
<p>Finding the right race for your next character can be difficult, it helps first to choose a kin that you’d like to explore, this could be randomly, but choosing it based on the kin’s tendencies can help you narrow in. Below are brief descriptions of the Kin, and what unifies all the races underneath them.</p>
<p>Elf-Kin are physically weak, but gain power in some other area because of that sacrifice.</p>
<p>Dwarf-Kin are hard workers, bread to perform specific tasks very well.</p>
<p>Human-Kin are adaptable, and helpful, staying in clans, and building great things.</p>
<p>Gnome-Kin are outcasts of society, forming small cohorts to protect each other.</p>
<p>Bird-Kin are winged curious creatures who work with the natural world.</p>
<p>Beast-Kin are solitary beings, whose ancestors were once animals themselves.</p>
<p>Goblin-Kin are tribal creatures dealt a poor hand in life.</p>
<h2 id="an-example-race"><a class="header" href="#an-example-race">An Example Race</a></h2>
<p>The name would be above, and this text here would be a description, generally of culture, significance in Ver, and other notable things of the race. The block of text closes out with what the race tends to worship, be that gods, dragons, ancient creatures, or nothing at all.</p>
<p>Mods: Values you MUST add to your Attributes (ATT).</p>
<p>Body Type: A link to the race’s Body Type.</p>
<p>Languages: The languages the race speaks by default.</p>
<p>Racial: This is a passive or ability which is specific to your race, which exemplifies your race’s culture or an ability specific to them.</p>
<p>Finally, below the stats of the race is a description of the races appearance as well as their expected life span, height and weight. This can be very important as lots of races can use their body to their advantage, such as Fairy elves which can glide with their wings. All of the things in the appearance are recommendations though. If you want to play something that doesn’t fit within the bounds of the appearance feel free, just run it by your Game Master first.</p>
<h2 id="summary-4"><a class="header" href="#summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Your character’s race will grant several changes to their ATT, a Body Type, default Languages, and a Racial Ability or Passive. It’s worth taking a moment to ask your GM about how your character’s race fits into society in your campaign, as this can have a significant effect on how other characters and players react to your presence.</p>
<h1 id="body-type"><a class="header" href="#body-type">Body Type</a></h1>
<p>Body type puts races in general categories, and has some gameplay implications. Body type is a general size. Below are the body types, and their effects.</p>
<p>Toughness is your general well being it indicates how resilient you are to taking significant damage in the form of Wounds.</p>
<p>Resilience is how resilient you are to gaining wounds, that is how much toughness you regain when you take a significant hit.</p>
<p>Base Defense, this is a basic defense you add to all defense types. It reflects your character’s size, and difficulty (or ease) to hit them.</p>
<p>Armor Class is how heavy the armor you can wear is. This should also be used to estimate how much stuff you can carry.</p>
<h2 id="common-body-types"><a class="header" href="#common-body-types">Common Body Types</a></h2>

<h2 id="summary-5"><a class="header" href="#summary-5">Summary</a></h2>
<h1 id="skills"><a class="header" href="#skills">Skills</a></h1>
<p>Skills are the things that your character can do that you can’t just pick up and
learn in a day or two. Skills are things like cooking food, fighting with a
longsword, and enchanting magical items. They are things like playing chess, and
haggling, and lifting weights. Skills are highly</p>
<p>customizable and can be made to be either very general, such as taking a skill
in all Athletic activities, or incredibly specific, like a Trivia skill focusing
only on the anatomy of vampire bats. The more specific a skill is, the higher a
bonus it will grant you. Each skill is linked to a single ATT and can only be
used in a Skill Check that is also using that ATT.</p>
<h1 id="component-skills"><a class="header" href="#component-skills">Component Skills</a></h1>
<p>Skills are made of different parts called Components pulled from the table
below, which will designate what the Skill is used for and how specific the
Skill is. Each Component has a value associated with it and the total of all the
Component’s values is the Skill’s Bonus. More Components means a more specific
Skill and a higher ending Bonus. You can make a Skill with as few or as many
Components as you like, and are encouraged to talk with your GM if you aren’t
sure how to make the Skill you want with what is available in the base game.</p>
<p>You and your GM are encouraged to invent components that don’t exist to fit your
character’s playstyle and background. When creating new Components you should
look at Components with the same Bonus and ask if the new component you are
Creating provides about the same level of specificity, or is very similar to
pre-existing Components. For instance ‘Joy’ and ‘Anger’ are +4 CNT Components,
so ‘Grief’ would be a reasonable +4 Component as well.</p>
<p>The first component to any Skill is its Base. A Skill Base will determine the
breadth of the Skill (what all it can be used for) as well as its relevant ATT,
and grant a starting Bonus. The ‘Athletics’ Base for instance is a VIG Base that
grants a +2 Bonus. Any Skill with the Athletics Base then can be used to perform
Athletic activities such as running, exercising, climbing, swimming, and so on.</p>
<p>All other Components will restrict the Skill and make it more specific in
exchange for a higher Bonus. After Athletics you could take ‘Climbing’ for a +2
Bonus which would only allow you to do Athletics activities related to Climbing.
From there you could take  ‘While Inebriated’ for a +3 Bonus and ‘Axe’ for a +2
Bonus. Now you have the Skill: ‘Athletics, Climbing, While Inebriated, Axe’ with
a total Bonus of +9, but to apply it to a Skill Check you must be Climbing,
while drunk, and using an Axe to help you climb.</p>
<p>It should be noted that being drunk and using an axe to climb a cliff may make
the climb more difficult, and apply Circumstantial penalties to you, so you
should be careful before you pile on too many extra Components to your Skills.
Be sure to communicate with your GM about the Skills you have, how you want them
to work, and in what situations would the GM apply Circumstantial penalties to
you, because while climbing a stone cliff with an axe while drunk might be
harder than doing it normally, having an axe and a bit of liquid courage might
help in climbing an icy cliff with a horrifyingly long drop beneath it.</p>

<h1 id="buying-and-upgrading-skills"><a class="header" href="#buying-and-upgrading-skills">Buying and Upgrading Skills</a></h1>
<p>Skills are bought using LP and have a Rating associated them. The first time you
buy a Skill it costs 1 LP, and has a Rating of Lousy (1). You can then upgrade
this to a Unremarkable (2) Rating for 2 additional LP. Then 3 LP to upgrade to
Great (3) and so on. The Bonus a skill provides is equal to its initial bonus
multiplied by its Rating. So a Great (3) Skill with a +5 Bonus grants a +15
Bonus and so on. You can only upgrade a Skill to a certain Rating depending on
your Level as outlined in this table:</p>

<p>You can only have a certain number of different  Background and Component skills
based on your EDU. This is your Skill Cap and it is:</p>
<p>\[ 4+\frac{EDU}{3} \]</p>
<p>At Level 1, you start with two Unremarkable Background skills, and one
Unremarkable Component skill.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-and-constitution-skills"><a class="header" href="#weapon-and-constitution-skills">Weapon and Constitution Skills</a></h2>
<p>Weapons and Constitutions significantly change what your character can do, but
require a bit of know-how to use. If you do not have an applicable Skill, but
attempt to perform a Skill Check that uses a weapon or constitution, you take a
Circumstance -10 penalty.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that not all weapons can use all Constitutions or the
same ATT. For instance, you cannot use Artisan’s Implements with the Delight
Constitution and so a Skill in ‘Delight Constitution, Artisan’s Impments’ is
effectively useless.</p>
<p>You can find what Constitutions a weapon can be used with in the Weapon
documents or under Component Definitions, the last section on this page.</p>

<h1 id="languages"><a class="header" href="#languages">Languages</a></h1>
<p>Languages are the various ways creatures can communicate in Ver. By default you
get</p>
<p>\[ 3+\frac{EDU}{3}\]</p>
<p>Language slots. The minimum number of language slots is 2. meaning even at -6
COG  you have 2 language slots.</p>
<p>Learning languages. Your race will give you one or more languages you have
learned. You know these. After that you have to learn languages on your own. Any
language can be learned by studying a Language’s tome for 5 weeks. Or being
taught by a professor for 168 hours (3 weeks).</p>
<p>Common is the exception. Common can be learned at character creation for free,
or picked up by being with people speaking common for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Below are short descriptions of some languages.</p>
<h2 id="common"><a class="header" href="#common">Common</a></h2>
<p>Common is the language of Ver, spoken by most creatures in Ver. This
language was originally the language of the Kalics, but over time it has
incorporated many different language’s words. Different creatures’ accents
influence the style of common they speak very heavily, and there are many words
for the same concept.</p>
<h2 id="dwarvish"><a class="header" href="#dwarvish">Dwarvish</a></h2>
<p>The language of the dwarves, dwarvish is a hard brash language. The
language echoes well, and the primary dwarven accent allows for most words to be
yelled with ease.</p>
<h2 id="floran"><a class="header" href="#floran">Floran</a></h2>
<p>Spoken by many creatures of the forest, floran uses a lot of body
language, and various sounds to mean the same thing so that many different
creatures can speak it. Some words in floran are even communicated through
scent.</p>
<h2 id="goran"><a class="header" href="#goran">Goran</a></h2>
<p>The language of the Goran, music is at its core. Goran has a specific
cadence, and messing it up can mean saying something very different.</p>
<h2 id="lingvo"><a class="header" href="#lingvo">Lingvo</a></h2>
<p>A language created by the Teleks to replace their old language. Lingvo
is incredibly regular, and easy to pronounce, but has very specific compound
words for describing exactly what you want.</p>
<h2 id="nomadic"><a class="header" href="#nomadic">Nomadic</a></h2>
<p>A language of traders, and adventurers, Nomadic has its roots in many
languages, primarily Goran, Dwarvish, and Floran.</p>
<h1 id="elemental-force"><a class="header" href="#elemental-force">Elemental Force</a></h1>
<p><strong>Governed by Questona, Dragon of Force, their words declare:</strong> All forces have
an equal and equivalent reaction. Force can be applied to objects as a
directional vector, which pushes or pulls on them. The resulting reaction is a
force of equal power and opposite direction being applied to you. Force can also
be used to manifest physical objects and barriers which are almost impossible to
destroy, and nearly invisible to the naked eye. The resulting reaction is that
maintaining one of these barriers renders the caster immobile except for very
minor movements, such as blinking, breathing, and speaking slowly. This only
effects the caster’s muscles though, and they can be tipped over, moved,
carried, or knocked around as normal.</p>
<h2 id="details"><a class="header" href="#details">Details</a></h2>
<p>To imagine the cognitive load, you can liken Force magic to doing Vector
calculations in your head.</p>
<p>In Turn Time, a maintained force object can be manipulated directly with a Quick
Action. Maintaining a force object does not prevent you from creating force
vectors.</p>
<h1 id="elemental-space"><a class="header" href="#elemental-space">Elemental Space</a></h1>
<p><strong>Governed by Psicorna, Dragon of Space, her words declare:</strong> Space can be
understood as an infinite field of points which can be stretched and compressed.
You can manipulate individual points by exchanging them, reorienting them, or
linking them together. Exchanged points will also exchange anything occupying
where the points were. Reorienting points can be used to rotated objects or
regions of space. Linked points act as the same point and anything passing
through one will come out the other one, by default the direction is maintained
but a practiced space mage can change this orientation by first linking them and
then reorienting one of the points.</p>
<h2 id="details-1"><a class="header" href="#details-1">Details</a></h2>
<p>You cannot link or influence points in another plane or universe, but you can
access a special extra dimensional plane called The Scraps. This plane was
created by Psicorna and space mages can reserve regions within it to create
extra-dimensional pockets that linger and can be accessed repeatedly by the
space mage. To do this you must briefly contact Psicorna and she will give you a
region of space relevant to your power.</p>

<h1 id="skill-checks-and-attacks"><a class="header" href="#skill-checks-and-attacks">Skill Checks and Attacks</a></h1>
<h2 id="skill-checks"><a class="header" href="#skill-checks">Skill Checks</a></h2>
<p>While most things your character does will not require a roll--like eating
breakfast, opening a door, or walking down the street--the important things you
do will. When you’re faced with climbing a sheer cliff, trying to decapitate a
charging orc, or attempting to charm your way into a party without an
invitation you will need to make a Skill check.</p>
<p>When performing a Skill Check, first you roll 1d20, then add:</p>
<ul>
<li>A relevant ATT score</li>
<li>Add up to one Skill which is applicable to what you’re trying to do and
matches the ATT being used</li>
<li>The Bonus of up to one piece of equipment (weapon or tool) you’re using to
perform the Skill Check.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have a Skill which can be applied to a Skill check you will still
apply one ATT score, though you’re welcome to bargain with the GM as to which
one it should be.</p>
<p>After you have rolled your die, and added your ATT and Skill the GM will
describe how your attempt turns out in line with the rating system described in
The Basics. So a result of 1-10 will be an Unremarkable attempt, 11-20 a Good
attempt, and so forth. In the case that your attempt is not enough-- for
instance a Good try at climbing a Legendary cliff--you have failed or in some
way only half succeeded.</p>
<p>Fail or succeed, a Skill Check will always advance the story, have real
consequences, and can not be immediately repeated by either you or another
character. If you fail to climb the cliff you may fall and break your leg,
causing the party to need to set camp, and set your leg back in place. Or you
may catch yourself halfway through the fall and find an entrance to a cave
tunnel which allows you to find a different, longer way to the top. Or you may
make it partway up the cliff, and realize that you could climb the rest of the
way, but it would take you twice as long to do so as you initially thought it
would. You will not, however make it halfway up the cliff and then need to make
a second identical roll to make it the rest of the way. Skill checks, whether
they fail or succeed, are made a single time, and advance the story.</p>
<h2 id="circumstance"><a class="header" href="#circumstance">Circumstance</a></h2>
<p>When performing a Skill check you can gain a bonus or penalty to your roll
called Circumstance, based on temporary or situational things that either aid
or hinder your attempt. If you’re attacking a target and another ally is
flanking and distracting them this could grant you a Circumstance bonus. If you
had sprained your wrist and were using a sword on the same attack you could
take a Circumstance penalty. Circumstance is always given in ranks of plus or
minus 5, 10, 15, 20, etc, and players are encouraged to ask about and suggest
giving out Circumstantial bonuses while playing.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Circumstance is always given to the person performing a
Skill check. So if a person is taking cover from an archer behind a stump, then
the archer takes a Circumstance penalty to their attack, instead of the
defender gaining a circumstance bonus to their defense.</p>
<h3 id="critical-failure-and-success"><a class="header" href="#critical-failure-and-success">Critical Failure, and Success</a></h3>
<p>When performing a Skill Check if you roll either a 1, or a 20, on your 1d20,
then your attempt either Critically Failed (in the case of a 1) or Critically
Succeeded (in the case of a 20). In the case of a Critical Failure treat a roll
of 1 as a -10, and regardless of the total result your action will go awry, or
fail outright in some way. In the case of a Success, treat the 20 as a 30, and
regardless of the total result your action will succeed in some spectacular
way, at least partially. After either of these take place the GM will put down
a square of Empowered Ground nearby, a type of special Terrain (see Terrain
Below) that will grant Circumstance to anyone who stands in it.</p>
<h2 id="attacks"><a class="header" href="#attacks">Attacks</a></h2>
<p>While many Skill Checks will be made against static things which cannot defend
themselves, such as cliffs that need climbing, doors that need bashing, and
locks that need picking, an equal amount will be made charming guards, killing
nobles, and teleporting goblins off of cliffs. In this case the Skill Chec is
considered an attack and target will defend against it as outlined in the next
section, Defense.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Attacks made from stealth--or on targets otherwise
unaware or unable to defend themselves--will gain Circumstance or will bypass
defense. Usually a totally unaware or helpless target will be treated as
without defense, while an alert but unaware target will still get their
defense, but the attacker will gain Circumstance.</p>
<h3 id="contests"><a class="header" href="#contests">Contests</a></h3>
<p>In the event of a Contest between two targets, such as arm-wrestling, playing
cards, or the like, then both parties should perform a Skill Check and the
higher one wins out.</p>
<h2 id="summary-6"><a class="header" href="#summary-6">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Every time you roll a die to perform an Action it is a Skill Check. While
making a Skill you first add an applicable ATT, any Circumstantial modifiers,
and then may add up to one applicable Skill, and the Bonus from up to one tool
or weapon you are using to perform the Skill Check. Fail or succeed, your Skill
Check will move the story forward and cannot be repeated or attempted a second
time.</p>
<h1 id="defense"><a class="header" href="#defense">Defense</a></h1>
<p>Keeping yourself alive and in good physical and emotional health is a
prerequisite for any and all other adventures you might undertake. Take care of
yourself out there.</p>
<h2 id="toughness"><a class="header" href="#toughness">Toughness</a></h2>
<p>Toughness is your general wellbeing and represents your resistance to suffering
major injuries. Your Max Toughness is determined by your Body Type and VIG, and
represents your ability to withstand injury after a Good Night’s Rest. A person
fresh to battle with full toughness may well shrug off an attack that would have
done serious damage to someone who was already exhausted, and suffering from
other minor injuries. As you fight you will lose Toughness by being hit
physically, but it also accounts for your mental and emotional well being.
Emotional suffering or discomfort can also cause you to lose Toughness.
Toughness usually regenerates fully every time you rest, but long lasting
effects such as lingering wounds, poisons, diseases, or failing to take care of
your bodily needs can cause you to temporarily lose Max Toughness until they are
resolved.</p>
<h2 id="defense-types"><a class="header" href="#defense-types">Defense Types</a></h2>
<p>Your character has an array of different defense stats which can make them
highly resistant against some types of attack, but vulnerable to others. These
defenses fall into three general groups, each of which corresponds to an
Attribute: Dexterous Defense with DEX, Cognitive Defense with COG, and Resolve
Defense with RES. Specifically they are:</p>
<h3 id="dexterous"><a class="header" href="#dexterous">Dexterous:</a></h3>
<p><strong>Escape</strong>, for escaping a grapple, falling into a pit trap, or holding your
balance in a wind.</p>
<p><strong>Blunt</strong>, for hard impacts, heavy clubs, blasts of force, and rolling boulders.</p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong>, for bladed and piercing weapons, being impaled on a wall of spikes,
swords, shards of ice.</p>
<h3 id="cognitive"><a class="header" href="#cognitive">Cognitive:</a></h3>
<p><strong>Thaumic</strong>, for resisting manifested magic, lightning bolts, fireballs, and
enchanted weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Null</strong>, for nullifying magic that directly targets you, teleportation, slowing
and paralysing magic.</p>
<p>**Wit, **for defending against trickery and deceit in debate, the streets, the
battlefield, and beyond.</p>
<h3 id="resolve"><a class="header" href="#resolve">Resolve:</a></h3>
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>, for resisting a direct spiritual assault, or bodily
transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Aegis</strong>, for resisting physical manifestations of spiritual effects, divine
smites, and necrosis.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>, for resisting emotional and mental duress, alterations, and attempts
to control.</p>
<p>Sometimes it may make sense to record bonuses for subsets of specific defense. A
magical potion might, for instance, only grant a resistance to heat, but not
cold. In this case it wouldn’t increase Thaumic Defense, instead you would note
the bonus elsewhere on your character sheet and apply it when defending against
a heat attack.</p>
<p>These defense types are based on your <a href="gameplay/../creating-a-character/body-type.html">Body
Type</a>, and you can find their starting
value on that page.</p>
<h2 id="defending-against-attacks"><a class="header" href="#defending-against-attacks">Defending Against Attacks</a></h2>
<p>When targeted by a hostile effect, be it magic or an axe swing, you will have a
chance to defend yourself before it hits. First determine what kind of attack it
is, and what defense type you will need to use to defend against it. This is
usually fairly obvious, but your GM will make the final call if it is needed.
Then take the final value of the effect and subtract the Defence Type which best
applies.</p>
<p>If the remaining number is less than or equal to 0, you successfully block,
avoid, or resist the effect. If the remaining value is greater than 0 you have
been hit or the effect has taken hold. If the remaining value is also greater
than your current Toughness you gain a Wound, a severe injury with possibly long
lasting consequences. This is a lingering debuff which is detailed by the GM,
wounds are explained more later. If the remaining value is, however, less
thanyour remaining Toughness then one of two things can happen.</p>
<p>If the effect does not do direct harm to your character (does not remove
Toughness) it takes effect normally. If the effect is directly damaging you lose
Toughness equal to the Shred stat of the effect (usually dictated by the weapon
it was made with).</p>
<h2 id="spirit-sense"><a class="header" href="#spirit-sense">Spirit Sense</a></h2>
<p>When someone attempts to be stealthy around unaware targets this is treated as
an attack made against their Spirit Sense, plus any one relevant skill that you
have (such as Empathy, Perception, Disguise Detection, etc). This will usually
be done privately by the GM without the defender’s knowledge, unless they
successfully ‘defend’ against the deception. Spirit Sense is \(10 + CNT\)</p>
<h2 id="summary-7"><a class="header" href="#summary-7">Summary</a></h2>
<p>There are nine different types of defense. Cut, Blunt, Escape, Thaumic, Null,
Wit, Resilience, Agis, and Will. All of which are used to defend against
different types of attacks. You will have to choose carefully which of these
defense types you want to be well protected against, and will likely always have
one or two glaring vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>When you are attacked subtract your relevant Defense from the incoming attack.
If this reduces it below zero the attack misses or is ineffective. If the attack
is greater than zero and greater than your current Toughness, you suffer a
Wound. If the attack is greater than zero and less than your current Toughness,
you loose Toughness equal to the Attack’s Shred value.</p>
<h1 id="fortification"><a class="header" href="#fortification">Fortification</a></h1>
<p>It is, barring divine or draconic intervention, impossible to instantaneously
heal a person’s wounds, or restore Toughness. Instead of healing, holy priests,
and other defenders of the meak work to prevent damage from being done in the
first place.</p>
<p>They do this by granting Fortification, a temporary but powerful boost to a
Specific Defense Type. The form this takes is dependent on its source. Thermal
Fortification granted by Wordix may take the shape of a halo of golden fire, and
Cut Fortification may look like a shimmering sphere of light. Fortification
effects made with RES can grant any type of Fortification, but more than just
RES effects can create Fortification.</p>
<p>An ice mage for instance, may be able to grant Fortification against heat by
chilling a target, and a mentalist may be able to do the same for Duress. In
these cases however you should always be clear how you’re granting the
Fortification, to ensure it makes narrative sense, and record it as exactly what
it is. So Fortification against heat granted from an ice mage should be noted as
such, and not added to Thermal Defense.</p>
<p>Fortification lasts until its recipient has taken one full turn. Below is a
table outlining the amount of Fortification an effect grants to a single target
based on its Rating. If you want to split this among multiple targets, or make
it last longer, you should consult your GM.</p>
