                        <h1 id="the-basics"><a class="header" href="#the-basics">The Basics</a></h1>
<p>This section is all about teaching you the basics of Tales of Ver on a
conceptual level, rather than a mechanical one. You won't learn how to attack a
goblin, or become a raging mechanical barbarian, but you will learn what the
game is about, what you'll need to play, and a lot of the words we use to talk
about Tales of Ver in later chapters.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-tales-of-ver"><a class="header" href="#what-is-tales-of-ver">What is Tales of Ver?</a></h1>
<p>Tales of Ver is a roleplaying game like Pathfinder, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Mutants
&amp; Masterminds, and more. The game gives you a world and character that you can
explore with your friends. Tales of Ver or ToV for short is all about
storytelling freedom in the world of Ver.</p>
<h1 id="sculpting-a-body--personality"><a class="header" href="#sculpting-a-body--personality">Sculpting a Body &amp; Personality</a></h1>
<p>What is a character? On a character sheet a character is a collection of stats,
skills, talents, and items, representing what the character is good and bad at.
In a story a character is a collection of values, goals, beliefs, and
potentially a sense of justice. It represents a person. This is what you should
set out to build when creating a character in Ver.</p>
<p>When crafting your character the game will guide you through finding out what
you are good at (and what you are bad at), but it is up to you to really shape
your character. Ask yourself questions like why you are good at weilding a
sword, or why you can chop a tree down really well. These will guide you nicely
into a character that feels whole and complete. Be hesitant to fill in every
detail though, one of the joys of roleplaying is discovering parts about your
character you never knew as the story develops.</p>
<p>The game will give you strengths and weaknesses, a fun character will have just
as interesting strengths as weaknesses. Lean into your strengths, if you are
good with a sword, then enter competitions, or train others, let it help define
you. Similarly, if you cannot barter whatsoever, then perhaps shopping is a big
hobby of yours, or you’ve always wanted to open a shop for yourself. Leaning
into your strengths will make you feel incredible, and leaning into your
weaknesses will have you laughing hard.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Be sure to think of your character as a real person, rather than a collection
of statistics. Ask yourself questions about why you’re good at different things.
Lean into your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-character-sheet">What is a Character Sheet</a></h1>
<p>A character sheet is a tool for you to remember all the information about your
character. This can be whatever works best for you; a piece of paper, a
spreadsheet, an encrypted document.  We have provided a character sheet pdf file
with most everything you need. Be sure to keep good track of this, especially if
you’re recording it on paper.</p>
<p>Individual stats and attributes can be found all throughout the rules, but the
ones you need to record on your character sheet have also been collected into
the Character Sheet Cheat Sheet for convenience. If you keep forgetting a stat,
don’t be afraid to write down the equation for it on your character sheet,
rather than constantly referencing the Cheat Sheet.</p>
<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>A Character sheet is where you keep track of the various statistics for your
character. You can use the provided PDF file, or create your own. If you ever
don’t know what is supposed to go some place on your character sheet, check the
Character Sheet Cheat Sheet.</p>
<h1 id="character-sheet-details"><a class="header" href="#character-sheet-details">Character Sheet Details</a></h1>
<p>Below are the details of the different slots, and textboxes on your character sheet, broken into a few different sections. This refers to the original pdf, but if you are using your own the formulas, and general uses for different sections will be similar.</p>
<h2 id="identifiers-section"><a class="header" href="#identifiers-section">Identifiers Section</a></h2>
<p>In the top left of the pdf are 4 stats, Character Name, Level, LP, and Victory/Despair.</p>
<p>Character name is the name of your character. This is just an identifier. Maybe your real name is “Stanley”, but you go by “Dark Shadow.” Whatever it is, it is the best name to call your character.</p>
<p>Level is a number from 1 to 10 which tells how experienced you are. It starts at 1, unless otherwise specified, and goes up by 1 every time you have checked victory and despair.</p>
<p>LP ranges from about 0 to 50. LP is used to buy Skills and Talents. You’ll gain about 5 LP for every level. It’ll start at 0.</p>
<p>Victory/Despair These are checkboxes. You gain a Victory (the top half) whenever something really good happens to you. You gain a Despair (the bottom half) whenever something really bad happens to you. Once both have been checked then you gain a level, and remove the check marks.</p>
<h2 id="information-section"><a class="header" href="#information-section">Information Section</a></h2>
<p>In the top right of the pdf are 10 different bits of information, including mechanical information, like Player Name, Race, and Body type, as well as more informative stats like, Worship, Age, Weight and Height.</p>
<p>Player Name is your real life name, or whatever you’d like to be called.</p>
<p>Race is your character’s race, you select it at character creation and it influences body type, as attributes, and racials.</p>
<p>Body Type is determined by your race, and influences your Toughness, Carrying, and other things.</p>
<p>Worship is whatever your character’s faith is, or highest thing you answer to. This can be left blank if you are unsure, or could be a God, Association, Friend, or even yourself. In general this would be a God or being of high power that you follow though.</p>
<p>Homeland is wherever your character is from.</p>
<h1 id="character-progression"><a class="header" href="#character-progression">Character Progression</a></h1>
<p>Characters start at Level 1 with 0 Learning Points, Victory, and Despair. Level and Learning Points (LP) are the two different ways that your character grows. Level growth represents your character’s core features, and their growth as a person. While LP represents how skillful your character is. </p>
<h2 id="levels"><a class="header" href="#levels">Levels</a></h2>
<p>You gain Levels by combining one point of Victory and Despair. Victory is gained by experiencing significant emotional and material victories or good fortune; Despair is gained by experiencing significant defeat, emotional Despair, and failing when you most needed to succeed. You cannot have more than one “point” of Victory or Despair at a time, and when you level up you consume one “point” of Victory and Despair. Events which gain you Victory and Despair should be of a magnitude sufficient to make a lasting impression on them; The Level 5 hero of the realm won’t remember every bandit they’ve ever killed, but might remember rallying the militia of their hometown to defend against a goblin hoard. To grow to Level 2 for instance your Level 1 character might gain a point of Victory by protecting a beggar from a pair of street thugs, and then a point of Despair by having their equipment stolen by those same street thugs the next night. When your character dies or retires you should be able to write out all of their Victory and Despair, and what caused them, and gain a good feel for the character’s journey as a person. Levels range from 1 to 10. A level 1 character is roughly equivalent to a working class normal peasant, largely unremarkable. A Level 5 character is likely a well established member of the world. Possibly known locally for their skills and abilities. A Level 10 character is at the pinnacle of what is possible for mortal beings and can stand up to gods, and maybe even dragons. As you gain Levels your Attributes and other Stats will improve. </p>
<h2 id="learning-points-lp"><a class="header" href="#learning-points-lp">Learning Points (LP)</a></h2>
<p>Your GM will distribute LP to the party as you complete, either failing or succeeding, at different challenges. This could be fighting a monster, or failing to steal something from a noble, but, like Victory and Despair are gained only from problems that challenge your characters and force them to grow and adapt. Though GMs can distribute LP however they like, you should be gaining around five LP per Level. That is, around the time you have 5 LP, you should also be leveling up to second Level, 10 LP should coincide roughly with Level 2, and so on. LP is used to buy and upgrade Skills, and improve your character with special Talents. Talents represent significant changes or improvements to your character and can drastically change how they play and interact with the world. Your Talent Cap, the number of Talents you can buy, is equal to 1+LVL4.</p>
<h2 id="starting-at-higher-levels"><a class="header" href="#starting-at-higher-levels">Starting at Higher Levels</a></h2>
<p>If you and your group decide not to start at Level 1, use the table below to figure out starting amounts of LP for each Level. It is also recommended that GMs try to keep their players in the same ballpark in terms of levels as they advance, so you don’t have a party of level 3s with one level 5.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>LP</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>30</td><td>35</td><td>40</td><td>45</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Also keep in mind the amount of history, and notoriety your character has should make sense for your Level. A Level 1 represents potential, your first few adventures, Victory, and Despair will make up their backstory. A Level 3 or higher character though is likely somewhat established. Think about what they did to get where they are now, who they hurt and helped in doing so, and how they are known in the world around them.</p>
<h2 id="summary-2"><a class="header" href="#summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<p>You start at Level 1 with 0 LP. Levels and Learning Points (LP) represent how experienced your character is, from a Level 1 peasant, to a Level 10 god-slayer. You gain Levels from experiencing good things (Victories), and bad things (a Despair). Similarly you gain LP from attempting challenges. Both LP and Victories/Despairs should be gained from events relative to your character’s power. A Level 10 would not gain a Victory for defeating some thieves.</p>
<h1 id="attributes"><a class="header" href="#attributes">Attributes</a></h1>
<p>Attributes are your character’s core stats, and are the simplest distillation of your character’s capabilities. There are 6 Attributes each with scores which range from -15 to 15. When your character does something that requires a die roll you will always add one of these Attributes to the result, probably along with other bonuses from Skills and Equipment.</p>
<h2 id="vigor-vig"><a class="header" href="#vigor-vig">Vigor (VIG)</a></h2>
<p>Vigor is your raw strength, and physical limits of your body. It allows you to wear heavier armor into battle, and become a walking tank. You can also wield heavy weapons like Great Axes, Long bows, and Halberds. Crush stone with your bare hands and break down doors with your bare feet. Higher Vigor will let you chop down trees in a single blow, pick up 10m high stone statues, and win every game of tug o’ war. Lower Vigor leaves you meek and fragile, easy to wound, and struggling to carry the groceries home from the market.</p>
<h2 id="dexterity-dex"><a class="header" href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity (DEX)</a></h2>
<p>Dexterity is how well you can control your own body. It increases your reflexes and ability to dodge physical attacks. It allows you to move quickly and precisely, balancing on thin rafters, moving silently, performing elaborate dances and disabling deadly traps. You can use lighter weapons like Daggers, Short bows, and Spears. High Dexterity will let you slip past the palace guards unnoticed and remove ancient golden idols from their pressure plates without triggering the boulder trap. Low Dexterity will cause you to slip and stumble over even the smallest obstacles and accidentally drop the measuring cup of water as you move it from the water basin to the mixing bowl.</p>
<h2 id="education-edu"><a class="header" href="#education-edu">Education (EDU)</a></h2>
<p>Education is your learned knowledge and learning ability. It allows you to learn more Skills and Languages, and remember important bits of trivia as well as where you parked your horse drawn carriage. It also encompasses known academic knowledge, and can be used to identify magic, alchemy, and technological items. Some types of magic also rely on Education. High Education will turn you into a walking library of facts, drawing upon the esoteric techniques of the worlds greatest minds. Low Education will have you scratching your head in confusion, getting lost, and struggling to remember which berries you should and shouldn’t be eating.</p>
<h2 id="cognition-cog"><a class="header" href="#cognition-cog">Cognition (COG)</a></h2>
<p>Cognition is your raw mental processing power, and the ability to adapt to unfamiliar circumstances and think on your feet. It lets you win debates with sound logic, and outwit your opponents using new and innovative strategies. Cognition is also important for application of some academics, such as high level mathematics, mechanics, magic, and alchemy. Cognition is also used to compile clues into conclusions, and predict what people will do next. It is also used for some types of magic. High Cognition will turn you into a mastermind of prediction and reasoning, solving crimes and picking apart your enemies schemes as if they were toddlers. Low Cognition leaves you vulnerable to even the simples tricks and logical fallacies and will make any kind of mental exertion simply exhausting.</p>
<h2 id="resolve-res"><a class="header" href="#resolve-res">Resolve (RES)</a></h2>
<p>Resolve is your strength of will and ability to manipulate your own spirit and emotions. It allows you to regenerate faster, get back up after getting knocked down, and protects you from mental and spiritual intrusions. It also represents your emotional stability and self confidence, which is essential in getting others to put their confidence in you. Resolve can also weaponize your own emotion through personal mementos, allowing you to harm enemies, or protect allies, and manipulate your own spirit to attack or hide your presence. Many gods look for followers with high resolve and grant them their powers. High Resolve will let you gain the trust of the masses, and stand firm in the face of certain defeat. Low Resolve will have you cringing away from even minor wounds, and leave you vulnerable to coercion.</p>
<h2 id="connection-cnt"><a class="header" href="#connection-cnt">Connection (CNT)</a></h2>
<p>Connection and ability to manipulate and perceive the spirits of other creatures. It allows you to manipulate social situations, and get a better read on people around you. It also represents how attuned you are with the Bond, a spiritual network which connects every living thing. This can allow you to sense nearby spirits, use special Idols to mentally attack and manipulate targets, and use musical instruments to create wide reaching spiritual buffs and effects. Connection also allows you to maintain and use more spiritually imbued items at once. High Connection will charm others, out barter the owner of the local pawnshop, or detect the spirits of living things through walls and hiding places. Low Connection will render you socially awkward, and make it difficult for you to notice and understand other living things.</p>
<h2 id="starting-attribute-values"><a class="header" href="#starting-attribute-values">Starting Attribute Values</a></h2>
<p>When making a character your starting attributes are determined by rolling a d6, and subtracting 5 from the result. You will do this six times and can choose which attribute each value goes to. So when creating your character, roll 1d6 and subtract 5, six times. This will give you values between -4, and 1. You can then add a total of 3 points to your attributes, split in any way you’d like: +1 to three attributes, +2 to one, and +1 to another, or +3 to one. You will repeat this process of adding 3 points to your Attributes every time you level up. But make sure not to go over your attribute cap.</p>
<h2 id="attribute-caps"><a class="header" href="#attribute-caps">Attribute Caps</a></h2>
<p>There are caps to how high an attribute can be at any given level determined by the table below. </p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>ATT Cap</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Racial, equipment, and other bonuses to Attributes are applied after the Stat Cap, and allow you to exceed it. For instance, a race which gives you +1 to Vigor, could have a Vigor of 5 at level 1, and then gain the +1 from their race, causing them to have a Vigor of 6. It is a good idea to record this as 5+1 on your character sheet so you can distinguish from your bonus and your attribute.</p>
<h2 id="summary-3"><a class="header" href="#summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<p>The Attributes, and what they are used for are, in short:
Vigor: Your strength and athletic abilities. Heavy weapons.
Dexterity: Your precision and agility. Light weapons.
Education: Your memory and academic knowledge. Some magical effects.
Cognition: Your mental prowess and intuition. Some magical effects.
Resolve: Your spiritual strength and self confidence. Emotional effects.
Connection: Your social aptitude, and spiritual perception. Mental and musical effects.</p>
<p>Attributes are the core of your character, split into 6 different statistics, each allowing you to do different things. You calculate them by rolling 1d6-5 six times. Once you’ve rolled them all, you choose where each result goes. At each level (including level 1) you will add 3 attributes points, which can be split between the 6 different attributes however you’d like. There is a limit to how high an attribute can go based on your level. Racial mods, equipment, and other bonuses are applied after this cap, allowing you to surpass it.</p>
<h1 id="your-characters-race"><a class="header" href="#your-characters-race">Your Character’s Race</a></h1>
<p>Your race is a very fundamental part of your character. Your race influences your Attributes, and also gives you a passive. More importantly every race has stereotypes and culture associated with it that informs what type of character you’ll play, and how other characters in the game will react to you. Races all derive from a Kin. You have Dwarf-kin, and then the different races of Dwarves. Elf-kin, and then the different races of Elves. Kin all share some ancestors, or are born in similar ways.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-race"><a class="header" href="#choosing-a-race">Choosing a Race</a></h2>
<p>Finding the right race for your next character can be difficult, it helps first to choose a kin that you’d like to explore, this could be randomly, but choosing it based on the kin’s tendencies can help you narrow in. Below are brief descriptions of the Kin, and what unifies all the races underneath them.</p>
<p>Elf-Kin are physically weak, but gain power in some other area because of that sacrifice.</p>
<p>Dwarf-Kin are hard workers, bread to perform specific tasks very well.</p>
<p>Human-Kin are adaptable, and helpful, staying in clans, and building great things.</p>
<p>Gnome-Kin are outcasts of society, forming small cohorts to protect each other.</p>
<p>Bird-Kin are winged curious creatures who work with the natural world.</p>
<p>Beast-Kin are solitary beings, whose ancestors were once animals themselves.</p>
<p>Goblin-Kin are tribal creatures dealt a poor hand in life.</p>
<h2 id="an-example-race"><a class="header" href="#an-example-race">An Example Race</a></h2>
<p>The name would be above, and this text here would be a description, generally of culture, significance in Ver, and other notable things of the race. The block of text closes out with what the race tends to worship, be that gods, dragons, ancient creatures, or nothing at all.</p>
<p>Mods: Values you MUST add to your Attributes (ATT).</p>
<p>Body Type: A link to the race's Body Type.</p>
<p>Languages: The languages the race speaks by default.</p>
<p>Racial: This is a passive or ability which is specific to your race, which exemplifies your race’s culture or an ability specific to them.</p>
<p>Finally, below the stats of the race is a description of the races appearance as well as their expected life span, height and weight. This can be very important as lots of races can use their body to their advantage, such as Fairy elves which can glide with their wings. All of the things in the appearance are recommendations though. If you want to play something that doesn’t fit within the bounds of the appearance feel free, just run it by your Game Master first.</p>
<h2 id="summary-4"><a class="header" href="#summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Your character's race will grant several changes to their ATT, a Body Type, default Languages, and a Racial Ability or Passive. It's worth taking a moment to ask your GM about how your character's race fits into society in your campaign, as this can have a significant effect on how other characters and players react to your presence.</p>
<h1 id="body-type"><a class="header" href="#body-type">Body Type</a></h1>
<p>Body type puts races in general categories, and has some gameplay implications. Body type is a general size. Below are the body types, and their effects.</p>
<p>Toughness is your general well being it indicates how resilient you are to taking significant damage in the form of Wounds.</p>
<p>Resilience is how resilient you are to gaining wounds, that is how much toughness you regain when you take a significant hit.</p>
<p>Base Defense, this is a basic defense you add to all defense types. It reflects your character’s size, and difficulty (or ease) to hit them.</p>
<p>Armor Class is how heavy the armor you can wear is. This should also be used to estimate how much stuff you can carry.</p>
<p>Body Types:</p>
<p><strong>Tiny</strong>, roughly 30 - 60 cm tall. </p>
<p>Toughness: \(9+VIG \cdot 2\)</p>
<p>Tenacity: \(1+RES \cdot 3\)</p>

<h2 id="summary-5"><a class="header" href="#summary-5">Summary</a></h2>
<h1 id="skills"><a class="header" href="#skills">Skills</a></h1>
<p>Skills are the things that your character can do that you can’t just pick up and learn in a day or two. Skills are things like cooking food, fighting with a longsword, and enchanting magical items. They are things like playing chess, and haggling, and lifting weights. Skills are highly </p>
<p>customizable and can be made to be either very general, such as taking a skill in all Athletic activities, or incredibly specific, like a Trivia skill focusing only on the anatomy of vampire bats. The more specific a skill is, the higher a bonus it will grant you. Each skill is linked to a single ATT and can only be used in a Skill Check that is also using that ATT. </p>
<h1 id="component-skills"><a class="header" href="#component-skills">Component Skills</a></h1>
<p>Skills are made of different parts called Components pulled from the table below, which will designate what the Skill is used for and how specific the Skill is. Each Component has a value associated with it and the total of all the Component’s values is the Skill’s Bonus. More Components means a more specific Skill and a higher ending Bonus. You can make a Skill with as few or as many Components as you like, and are encouraged to talk with your GM if you aren't sure how to make the Skill you want with what is available in the base game. </p>
<p>You and your GM are encouraged to invent components that don’t exist to fit your character’s playstyle and background. When creating new Components you should look at Components with the same Bonus and ask if the new component you are Creating provides about the same level of specificity, or is very similar to pre-existing Components. For instance ‘Joy’ and ‘Anger’ are +4 CNT Components, so ‘Grief’ would be a reasonable +4 Component as well.</p>
<p>The first component to any Skill is its Base. A Skill Base will determine the breadth of the Skill (what all it can be used for) as well as its relevant ATT, and grant a starting Bonus. The ‘Athletics’ Base for instance is a VIG Base that grants a +2 Bonus. Any Skill with the Athletics Base then can be used to perform Athletic activities such as running, exercising, climbing, swimming, and so on.</p>
<p>All other Components will restrict the Skill and make it more specific in exchange for a higher Bonus. After Athletics you could take ‘Climbing’ for a +2 Bonus which would only allow you to do Athletics activities related to Climbing. From there you could take  ‘While Inebriated’ for a +3 Bonus and ‘Axe’ for a +2 Bonus. Now you have the Skill: ‘Athletics, Climbing, While Inebriated, Axe’ with a total Bonus of +9, but to apply it to a Skill Check you must be Climbing, while drunk, and using an Axe to help you climb. </p>
<p>It should be noted that being drunk and using an axe to climb a cliff may make the climb more difficult, and apply Circumstantial penalties to you, so you should be careful before you pile on too many extra Components to your Skills. Be sure to communicate with your GM about the Skills you have, how you want them to work, and in what situations would the GM apply Circumstantial penalties to you, because while climbing a stone cliff with an axe while drunk might be harder than doing it normally, having an axe and a bit of liquid courage might help in climbing an icy cliff with a horrifyingly long drop beneath it.</p>

<h1 id="buying-and-upgrading-skills"><a class="header" href="#buying-and-upgrading-skills">Buying and Upgrading Skills</a></h1>
<p>Skills are bought using LP and have a Rating associated them. The first time you buy a Skill it costs 1 LP, and has a Rating of Lousy (1). You can then upgrade this to a Unremarkable (2) Rating for 2 additional LP. Then 3 LP to upgrade to Great (3) and so on. The Bonus a skill provides is equal to its initial bonus multiplied by its Rating. So a Great (3) Skill with a +5 Bonus grants a +15 Bonus and so on. You can only upgrade a Skill to a certain Rating depending on your Level as outlined in this table:</p>

<p>You can only have a certain number of different  Background and Component skills based on your EDU. This is your Skill Cap and it is: </p>

<p>At Level 1, you start with two Unremarkable Background skills, and one Unremarkable Component skill.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-and-constitution-skills"><a class="header" href="#weapon-and-constitution-skills">Weapon and Constitution Skills</a></h2>
<p>Weapons and Constitutions significantly change what your character can do, but require a bit of know-how to use. If you do not have an applicable Skill, but attempt to perform a Skill Check that uses a weapon or constitution, you take a Circumstance -10 penalty. </p>
<p>It should also be noted that not all weapons can use all Constitutions or the same ATT. For instance, you cannot use Artisan’s Implements with the Delight Constitution and so a Skill in ‘Delight Constitution, Artisan’s Impments’ is effectively useless.</p>
<p>You can find what Constitutions a weapon can be used with in the Weapon documents or under Component Definitions, the last section on this page.</p>

<h1 id="languages"><a class="header" href="#languages">Languages</a></h1>
<p>Languages are the various ways creatures can communicate in Ver. By default you get </p>
<p>\( 3+\frac{EDU}{3}\)</p>
<p>Language slots. The minimum number of language slots is 2. meaning even at -6 COG  you have 2 language slots.</p>
<p>Learning languages. Your race will give you one or more languages you have learned. You know these. After that you have to learn languages on your own. Any language can be learned by studying a Language’s tome for 5 weeks. Or being taught by a professor for 168 hours (3 weeks).</p>
<p>Common is the exception. Common can be learned at character creation for free, or picked up by being with people speaking common for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Below are short descriptions of some languages.</p>
<h2 id="common"><a class="header" href="#common">Common</a></h2>
<p>Common is the language of Ver, spoken by most creatures in Ver. This language was originally the language of the Kalics, but over time it has incorporated many different language’s words. Different creatures' accents influence the style of common they speak very heavily, and there are many words for the same concept.</p>
<h2 id="dwarvish"><a class="header" href="#dwarvish">Dwarvish</a></h2>
<p>The language of the dwarves, dwarvish is a hard brash language. The language echoes well, and the primary dwarven accent allows for most words to be yelled with ease.</p>
<h2 id="floran"><a class="header" href="#floran">Floran</a></h2>
<p>Spoken by many creatures of the forest, floran uses a lot of body language, and various sounds to mean the same thing so that many different creatures can speak it. Some words in floran are even communicated through scent.</p>
<h2 id="goran"><a class="header" href="#goran">Goran</a></h2>
<p>The language of the Goran, music is at its core. Goran has a specific cadence, and messing it up can mean saying something very different.</p>
<h2 id="lingvo"><a class="header" href="#lingvo">Lingvo</a></h2>
<p>A language created by the Teleks to replace their old language. Lingvo is incredibly regular, and easy to pronounce, but has very specific compound words for describing exactly what you want.</p>
<h2 id="nomadic"><a class="header" href="#nomadic">Nomadic</a></h2>
<p>A language of traders, and adventurers, Nomadic has its roots in many languages, primarily Goran, Dwarvish, and Floran.</p>
