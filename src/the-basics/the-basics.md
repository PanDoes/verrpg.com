# The Basics

This section is all about teaching you the basics of Tales of Ver on a
conceptual level, rather than a mechanical one. You won't learn how to attack a
goblin, or become a raging mechanical barbarian, but you will learn what the
game is about, what you'll need to play, and a lot of the words we use to talk
about Tales of Ver in later chapters.
