# Human-Kin

Human-Kin are diverse and adaptable. They thrive both in civilized lands, and
at the fringes of the world. They also mix well with other races and though
together they may not be as wholly dominant as the Kalic, or have the influence
of the dwarven fortresses, they can be found any and everywhere.

## Vincal

Vincal are skilled communicators, diplomats, and team players. They are
commonly found in positions of political, or religious leadership, and are good
with people. They commonly worship the gods, especially Wordix and Hollbirth.

## Goran

The survivors, the wanderers, Goran live where living is hard and life can end
with the fall of a monster’s claw, or a frigid wind’s breath. They live
tribally, and don’t mix much with other races. Skill in combat is essential in
their barbarian society, and everything from personal disputes to politics can
be solved through conflict. They usually worship Grondshok, though a few follow
Wimble. Some of the more brutal tribes follow darker entities still.

## Harenite

Originally desert nomads, the Harenite center their whole culture around the
worship of higher powers. And not just a single god, or patron, Harenite are
famously multi-theistic, worshipping multiple higher powers equally, even those
with conflicting views. Some people are put off by this practice, but many
small communities welcome them as general priests for all the divines.
Regardless of their other devotions, almost all Harenite worship Hollbirth.
