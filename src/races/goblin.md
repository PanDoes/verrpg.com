## Gremlin

Small Creatures, Gremlins are unusually lucky, often using this to bet and
gamble their money. Gremlins can become fixated on certain items, this usually
manifests in them stealing it, but sometimes Gremlins will haggle for these
items, or bet them in games.

## Stronk

Huge Goblins, slightly larger than a Barbarian Human. What these monsters gain
in strength they lose in intelligence, lacking lots of common sense. Stronk
Goblins are known to attach themselves to someone, usually a chieftain goblin
and protect them with their life.
