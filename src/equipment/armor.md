# Armor

A character can wear one set of armor which, when bought, can be "skinned"
however you like, as long as it is representative of the armor's rating. So a
noble fighter might have their Great Armor look like a set of full plate, while
a wizard may choose a blue and red robe.

An armor's Armor Points is divided between the nine types of defense and may be
done however you like when you first buy it. If you are buying an Unremarkable
set of scrap plate armor you have 42 points to distribute. As it's plate armor
it will probably be better against cut, so maybe you put 10 points into Cut
Defense, and then 8 into both Blunt and Escape, and then decide to divide the
remaining 24 points between Thaumic, Thermal, Null, Constitution, Duress, and
Will (3 points each). Found armor will usually already have a preset skin and
division of its Value among the different Defense types.

You can pay to upgrade your armor, instead of buying a new set, by paying the
difference in cost between your sets current rating and the rating you are
upgrading to, and then distributing your new Armor Points however you like.

## Summary

Armor is essential to keeping you alive and can be skinned as a wide variety of
things. Each piece of armor grants a number of Armor Points based on its Rating
which you can divide between your different Defense Types.
