# Staff

A staff is a long wooden object, imbued with various magical materials and
artifacts. They come in all shapes and sizes, and occasionally feature some sort
of focus at on end to better strengthen the magical power.

Each staff is of a specific element, and may only be used with that element's
COG or EDU Constitution. For example "Remarkable Staff of Fire" or "Lousy Staff
of Ice."
