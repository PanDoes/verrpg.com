# Leveling Up Cheat-Sheet

When you gain a Level, the following things happen.

*   Add 3 to your Attributes. That is, add 1 to three different attributes, add
	2 to one attribute and 1 to a different attribute, or add 3 to one
	attribute.
*   You can refund one purchase of a skill, regaining the LP of that purchases
	cost. If I have a skill I’ve purchased 4 times, then if I refunded it I
	would regain 4 LP, and have a skill I’ve purchased 3 times.
*   Heal to full toughness

The following are affected by your level, and will change when you gain a new
one:

Attribute Cap, The max amount an attribute can be.

|        | | | | | |  |  |  |  |  |
|--------|-|-|-|-|-|--|--|--|--|--|
|Level   |1|2|3|4|5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|
|Stat Cap|5|6|7|8|9|10|12|14|15|15|

Talent Cap, your max talents are \\(1 + \frac{Level}{4}\\)

Possibly your Racial ability. Many racials scale based on your level.

Dexterous, Cognitive, and Resolve Defenses as defined by Body Type, if you are a
Medium character this scales by 3, otherwise check the Body Type document.
