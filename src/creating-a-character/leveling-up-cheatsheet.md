# Leveling Up Cheat-Sheet

When you gain a Level, the following things happen.

*   Add 3 to your Attributes, that is, add 1 to three of your attributes, add 2 to one of your attributes and 1 to another, or add 3 to one of your attributes.
*   You can refund skills. That is or regain one purchase worth of LP from a skill. If I have a skill I’ve purchased 4 times, then if I refunded it I would regain 4 LP, and have a skill I’ve purchased 3 times.
*   Heal to full toughness

The following are affected by your level, and will change when you gain a new one:

Attribute Cap, The max amount an attribute can be.
