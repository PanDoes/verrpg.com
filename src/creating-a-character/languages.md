Learning languages. Your race will give you one or more languages you have
learned. You know these. After that you have to learn languages on your own. Any
language can be learned by studying a Language’s tome for 5 weeks. Or being
taught by a professor for 168 hours (3 weeks).

Common is the exception. Common can be learned at character creation for free,
or picked up by being with people speaking common for 2 weeks.

Below are short descriptions of some languages.

## Common
Common is the language of Ver, spoken by most creatures in Ver. This
language was originally the language of the Kalics, but over time it has
incorporated many different language’s words. Different creatures' accents
influence the style of common they speak very heavily, and there are many words
for the same concept.

## Dwarvish
The language of the dwarves, dwarvish is a hard brash language. The
language echoes well, and the primary dwarven accent allows for most words to be
yelled with ease.

## Floran
Spoken by many creatures of the forest, floran uses a lot of body
language, and various sounds to mean the same thing so that many different
creatures can speak it. Some words in floran are even communicated through
scent.

## Goran
The language of the Goran, music is at its core. Goran has a specific
cadence, and messing it up can mean saying something very different.

## Lingvo
A language created by the Teleks to replace their old language. Lingvo
is incredibly regular, and easy to pronounce, but has very specific compound
words for describing exactly what you want.
