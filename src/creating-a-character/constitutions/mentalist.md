# Mentalist

**By traversing, and communicating through the Bond:** you can influence a spirit
discretely, implanting or reading emotions and ideas without a trace, or
assaulting the victim, overwhelming them with emotions or ideas. Known spirits,
either through familiarity or knowledge, are far easier to manipulate, and all
manipulation leaves a trace or scarring that is unique to each mentalist.
Emotions are like fire, they are intense but will quickly go out if not stoked.
Strong Mentalists know how to both stoke and smother the fire, as well as how
to move the fuel from one emotion to the next. Ideas are permanent--carved into
the walls of your head. Strong Mentalists know how to implant the ideas--both
long and sort term--they want, and suppress the ones they don't, covering old
thoughts behind layers of new ones. Beware, while it is possible for a skilled
mentalist to tell the difference between two peoples ideas, and thus identify
implanted thoughts, it is impossible for a mentalist to tell the difference
between their own ideas and the ones they have implanted in themselves.

## Details

It is not uncommon for Mentalists to fortify their own minds, creating complex
mazes, and palaces to hide their thoughts and ideas. Other mentalists attempting
to affect them, may find themselves physically navigating these tunnels, and
corridors. Additionally, some heroic mentalists have been able to pull others
into their minds, trapping them in their own mind jails, where they have full
control of the walls. But it is a dangerous thing having another person in your
mind.
