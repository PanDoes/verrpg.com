# Your Race

Your race is a key part of your character and lays out for you how you'll
determine your [Attributes](./attributes.md), and
[Defense Values](./defense.md), as well as give you Languages, and a powerful
Racial ability. If this is your first time reading about the game, it is
recommended you look at attributes and defenses *first* before choosing your
race, as it will help you make a more informed decision about the impacts on
your character.

## The different kin

The races are broken up into different "kin," or families of races. These groups
are determined based on lore reasons, which inform gameplay. Below are a list of
kin, and a small description of what makes the group distinct.

[Elf-Kin](../races/elf.md) are naturally weak, having traded their physical
strength for something much more valuable in their eyes, a connect to things
greater than themselves.

[Dwarf-Kin](../races/dwarf.md) are familial, and communal, with a strict
cast system regulating reproduction, they are specialists from birth, whether
they like it or not.

[Human-Kin](../races/human.md) are diverse and adaptable, striking a comfortable
balance in life.

[Gnome-Kin](../races/gnome.md) are the small outsiders of the world. To be a
gnome is not about blood or family, but about the little guys looking out for
eachother.
